# A bit about where I come from.
<p> I am a French citizen born close to Paris a while ago. My family lineage is quite typical to many parisians, in my blood are colors from Belgium, Germany, Swisserland and Italy. When it comes to see all thoughout generation my origins also from very diverses places of France like Brittany, NOrmany, Savoy in between others. </p>
I have raised with one sister 11 years older than me with whom I share being an anxious person which fight dark moments by emitting storm like laughs and finding in ourselves humour. Raised between passion for knowledge, church and raquest sport fields and martial arts, I had a great childhood with parents always provided me with a certain balance between self-esteem, hard work and diversion.
As far as I remembered I have also been curious about pretty much everything and convinced deeply in my soul that whatever intellectual challenge was in front of me, I could overcome it. With plenty of possibilities in front of me, I finally decided Science to be my life oriented motivation or this I thought.  And Oh God, I love teaching so much! This is what I should be! </p>

# A scientific career
<p> If science was my passion, enjoying life was even bigger in my heart. Teen time and late high school years where therefore about finding myself. Though in fact, I lost myself quite a bit. I remember thinking of being sportman, archeologist, marine biologist, carpenter, osteopath, martial art teacher, actor, humorist... So I dedicated efforts to pretty much everything that seduced me along the way. But if you dedicate efforts to A, you can dedicate them to B. So, school became slowly but surely not a point to reach knowledge but a place to make joke, have fun with friends and experience. So I was finally decided to something. I would be zoologist. Something that was good enough since my marks were continuasly falling as everything started to be a bit more complicated. </p>
<p> After few years lost, one day I find myself studying in one of the highest elistic scheme of the French eductional systems. </p>
<p> By the greatest opportunity that providence can bring (shuuutt, don't tell this to anyone, I do not believe in hazard...), I enter the Ecole Normale Supérieure to study chemistry. I get there thoughout the small door and left also by the small door, but this place gave me back something that during years I forgot about molecules, life and teaching. As I overcome barriers in the ENS hardcore learning, I get each time more excited about bioinorganic chemistry, computational chemistry and how we can relate molecules with health and technology.</p>

# What am I now?

<p>20 years have passed since the ENS. I had incredible mentors O. Eisenstein, F. Maseras, D. Perahia, L. Mouawad, A. Lledós, M. Sutcliffe, G. Roberts and a hand full of experiences in France, the UK and Spain. </p>
    <p>I became a computational chemist with a wide experience on a broad spectrum of techniques (i.e. from Homology Modeling, MD, QM/MM). My research interests are centered on the computationally aided molecular designs of bioactive molecules and supramolecular complexes. The work performed in my team is mainly dedicated to the development of integrative computational approaches for biomedicinal and biotechnological applications. Our research interests are broad although principally articulated around two main blocks: the study and prediction of drug efficiency and toxicological profiles (ADME and side effects) and the development of artificial enzymes. </p>
With time came computers, understanding the molecular grounds of life and putting a small sand bean on the transition of humanity to a better living mode.
    <p>In these two lines, a substantial amount of efforts is dedicated to metal containing systems. Hence, we are of the leader in simulating metal mediated protein-ligand interactions and eventually subsequent catalytic mechanisms. These interactions have mainly remained orphan of computational inputs so far and their understanding can open major avenues in fields as variables as the fight against Alzheimer disease, erradication of pathogens by iron starvation or the design of environmentally friendly artificial metaloenzymes.</p>

# My phylosophy
<p> This is a big word but I do not have other. _What are my drivers in my research?_ Abundance! Abundance of motivation for what I am studying, to the care of my colleagues (the youngest as well as the oldest), to find new friends, to discuss</p>
