My teaching activity includes ca. 3500 teaching hours in France (Université Paris Sud), the United Kingdom (University of Leicester) and, mainly, Spain.  

It can be summarized as follows:

### Bachelor / Degree

My teaching at this level has been mostly given at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (Spain) and covers from the first year to the fourth year of the grade of the Spanish university scheme. It covers a wide variety of grades such as Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Biology, Biochemistry, Environmental Sciences, Food Sciences and Technologies and Nanoscience and Nanotechnology.  

As a whole it can be divided into subjects of Physical Chemistry (i.e. Thermodynamics, Chemical Kinetics, Quantum Chemistry, etc.), General Chemistry (i.e. first year introduction) and Computational chemistry (i.e. Biosimulation, informatic ressources in chemistry, python). 

The main markers of this part of my activity are:
- more than 2600 hours taughts
- 40% on General Chemistry subjects and 60% in Physical Chemistry and Computational Chemistry subjects
- 65% as a main teacher
- 46% master classes, 44% practicum and 10% to problems and tutoring

### Masters

The courses I taught at this level is highly related to my research fields which are the molecular modeling of biochemical systems including drug and enzyme design as well as the development of new computational tools and programming.

My experience includes:
- 600 teaching hours of computational chemistry, molecular modeling and structural bioinformatics subjects. 
- spread between France and Spain
- in M. Sc. in chemistry, computational chemistry, biotechnology or bioinformatics

### Mentoring
This part of my work are all related to my research subjects and includes up to now:
1. Direction 11 Ph.Ds
2. Mentoring of 3 more Ph.D. during my stay in the United Kingdom 
3. Direction of 13 Grade thesis
4. Direction of 13 Master thesis. 
5. Direction of 3 exchange students (from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands)
